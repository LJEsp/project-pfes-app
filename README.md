# PFES App
This is a rebuild of my previous PFES App project using Material UI.

## Note
I've decided to terminate this project as it has become frustrating trying to make React, Material-ui forms, and Redux work together seamlessly without using stuff like React-Form. There are workarounds but I don't believe they promote good practices! :D
